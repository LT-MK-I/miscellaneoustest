# miscellaneoustest
Random tests I run on different components for other projects. 

This Repo will have a lot of the individual components tests or measurements. I think this Repo would be useful for employers to see that I actually know how to do certain things. 

A lot of tests will be posted here that are non-specific to certain projects, The purpose of this is just general documentation and some more organization with documentation.
Some smaller or miscellaneous projects may also be put here for organization.
